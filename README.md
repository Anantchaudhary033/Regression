# Regression
Regression is a method for understanding the relationship between independent variables/features and a dependent variable/outcome.
Linear regression involves finding a line that minimizes the difference between predicted and actual output values, typically achieved through the least squares method. Simple linear regression calculators utilize this approach to determine the best-fit line for a given set of paired data, allowing estimation of the dependent variable (X) based on the independent variable (Y).

# Problem Statement
We have a dataset comprising salaries of individuals alongside their respective years of professional experience. Our objective is to develop a linear regression model to accurately predict salaries based on an individual's experience. Additionally, we aim to assess the model's accuracy once established. 

# Variables
Dependent Variable - Salary
Independent Variable - YearsExperience
