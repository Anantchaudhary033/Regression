# Regression
Regression is a method for understanding the relationship between independent variables/features and a dependent variable/outcome.
Linear regression involves finding a line that minimizes the difference between predicted and actual output values, typically achieved through the least squares method. Simple linear regression calculators utilize this approach to determine the best-fit line for a given set of paired data, allowing estimation of the dependent variable (X) based on the independent variable (Y).
